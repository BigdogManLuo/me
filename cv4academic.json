            "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of deep learning–based methods for photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, their fundamental limitation lies in a strong reliance on site-specific historical data for end-to-end customized training. Newly commissioned PV plants often lack sufficient operational records, rendering reliable forecasting infeasible. PV nowcasting is largely determined by the structure, boundaries, and evolution of cloud fields, which are observable from satellite imagery and exhibit shared visual semantics across regions and satellite products. We formalize cold-start PV nowcasting as a visual-driven zero-shot trajectory forecasting problem under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. We propose a vision–language model (VLM)–conditioned retrieval-augmented framework that uses semantics as a bridge for cross-domain generalization and estimates future PV power trajectories via local conditional expectation in the learned representation space.",

            "abstract":"Decision-focused learning aligns the training of forecasting models with downstream decision outcomes. However, this end-to-end design inherently restricts the value of forecasting models to only a specific task structure, and thus generalize poorly to evolving tasks. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model across a varying tasks stream with a sustainable long-term computational burden.",
